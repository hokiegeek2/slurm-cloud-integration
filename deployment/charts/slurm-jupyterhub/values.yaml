    ## type: Recreate
    ## - JupyterHub's interaction with the CHP proxy becomes a lot more robust
    ##   with this configuration. To understand this, consider that JupyterHub
    ##   during startup will interact a lot with the k8s service to reach a
    ##   ready proxy pod. If the hub pod during a helm upgrade is restarting
    ##   directly while the proxy pod is making a rolling upgrade, the hub pod
    ##   could end up running a sequence of interactions with the old proxy pod
    ##   and finishing up the sequence of interactions with the new proxy pod.
    ##   As CHP proxy pods carry individual state this is very error prone. One
    ##   outcome when not using Recreate as a strategy has been that user pods
    ##   have been deleted by the hub pod because it considered them unreachable
    ##   as it only configured the old proxy pod but not the new before trying
